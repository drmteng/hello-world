# hello-world
My first try
Hello world,

This is my first attempt to creat a file in github using git. I have never done this before and I need to leard this in order to start writing some code. I will  probably write code in Python. Although I am also learning linux commands. It take awhile for me to get used to writting in the command line. But it is not as hard as I thought.
Thanks for listening.
